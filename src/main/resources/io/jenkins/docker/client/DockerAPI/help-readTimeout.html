<div>
    Timeout, in seconds, to apply when expecting data from the Docker API.
    0 means no time limit, but this is not recommended (if your docker API locks up, some aspects of Jenkins can also lock up).
    <p>
    NOTE: This timeout applies to <em>all</em> docker API actions.
    This includes docker pull requests (which can take some time to complete)
    as well as
    docker image builds (if it "goes quiet" for too long, your build will fail).
    <br/>
    i.e. you probably want this set to a few minutes, rather than a few seconds.
